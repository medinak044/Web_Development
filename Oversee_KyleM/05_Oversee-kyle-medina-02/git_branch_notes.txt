git branch
    - Checks available branches
git branch -c (new branch name)
    - Creates new branch
git checkout (branch name)
    - Switches to existing branch
git push origin head
    - I think this pushes to what branch you are currently on (git checkout (branch name))


* Assuming the main branch hasn't changed yet, here's how to merge to main branch in terminal:
- Must first be on the main branch (git checkout main)
git merge (branch name)


* There is the local branch, and the remote branch. Here's how to delete both types of branches:
git branch -d <local-branch>
git push origin --delete <remote-branch-name>
